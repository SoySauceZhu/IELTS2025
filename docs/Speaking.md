I think I'm the kind of people that is really eager to express themselves. So if i could i'd like to describe myself as an example. Some may not like the person that alway talking endlessly and try to show their opinion or thoughts and ideas, and thinking them annoying especially when the listener already fed up with them bull shitting. But I think that is only a point of perspective. I've grown up in a family that my parent always trying to cultivate my value of things. I don't like it at first, actually, I think some of their preaches is very un-democratic. But after years of education, from high school to university, from the protected fledgling to an adult who travel thousands of mile studying abroad, it turns out that many dogma and lines they've said it proof to be right. Therefore I thought to my self. Every lines of opinions is valuable if you critically think about it. So now, when I am spending time with my friends, I'd like to talk more and to show my opinions. Not for educating, but just inspiring others' wiser and better insights.

> What aspects do young people have strong opinions about?

It's hard to answer since there quite a variety of what young people is interested about. Some of them may really focus on their own study in school, so they may have strong opinions of the professors or the teaching of the modules. Some young generations might passionate about political campaigns, I think it's not rare either in western world nor in China. For these youngs, definitely, they will have strong and clear opinion about things such as human right, LGBT or the war if they are interested. 

> What aspects do old people have strong opinions about?

I don't really know old people from other countries than China. But in China, I think the generation as my parent would have strong opinion on their working and colleagues, or the marriage of the young people of their relatives. You know, many parents in China have always urging their children to get married once they have a job.

> Are childrenâ€™s opinions influenced by their parents?

 definitely, you could take myself as an example, I think the cultivation that my parents had done to me is really successful. Ive learned a lot from their lecturing, and the more I reflect their words, I found it more correct when I grown up and survive on my own in the society.
